# Puerto Rico

### This code obtains wind data for Puerto Rico from NREL's [National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/) to recreate the 20-year mean wind speed dataset contained in the [Puerto Rico 100 report](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/88615.pdf). For more information about the PR100 study, this the official [website](https://pr100.gov/).

#### Good resources for how to obtain and manipulate the NSRDB data are contained in NREL's [Github repository](https://github.com/NREL/hsds-examples) for HSDS:

#### Data
* NREL hosts wind data for Puerto Rico within its Wind Toolkit ([website](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/wind-toolkit.html), [GitHub](https://github.com/NREL/hsds-examples/blob/master/datasets/WINDToolkit.md)). These data exist at 5 minute increments across a year between 2001 and 2020.
